# archiver

Simply moves all items in a directory into an `archive` folder. Keeps copies, does not delete any files.

## How to use
Include the path to the `bin` folder in your path

Call `archive` whenever you're in a directory. All files/directories will be moved into an `archive` folder (resolving naming conflicts).

## Build
```
make clean build
```
